Updated postcodes
------------------
It is possible to update the postcodes yourself, but I do not recommend it.

1. Check if the postcodes are up to date:
   Go to "http://epab.posten.no/" and click on "Nedlasting" on the bottom 
   of the page. If the date is older than the one given in the line after
   "##mkpostalinfo begin" in NO.pm

2. Fetch updated postcodes:
   Get the file "http://epab.posten.no/Norsk/Nedlasting/_Files/tilbud5.txt",
   and save it in the "./bin" directory.

3. Update the postcodes:
   Give the command "./bin/mkpostalinfo".
   The old version of NO.pm is automatically renamed (with a trailing dot and
   a large numer). Check the new file, as errors can occur if the structure of
   the postcode file has changed.

   A new file "NO.pm" is generated, with updated postcodes.

4. Install the module:
   Give the command 'make test install'.

An explanation of the syntax on the postcode file  is given in the following
document: "http://epab.posten.no/Norsk/Nedlasting/_Files/NorLayout.doc".

Note that the tests (in "make test") are hard coded for a few selected
postcodes, and can stop functioning if there are changes in one of them.
I recommend that you instead wait for a new and updated version of the
module.
