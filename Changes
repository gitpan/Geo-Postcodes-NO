   'eg/multiselection_no'.

   the core selection procedure/method.

 * Released version 0.03.

2006-07-23 10:00 Arne Sommer

  online examples.

   locations) to a norwegian text.

2006-07-19 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Merged the national (norwegian and danish) postal type codes, and moved
   them to the base class. 'type' and 'type_of' will now give the code
   (instead of the description) . Use the new prodeure 'type_verbose_of' and
   method 'type_verbose' for the description. The base class has english
   texts, but this is overruled by norwegian texts by this module.
